## Hash Table Program

Dustin Horvath

#### Builds 3 hash tables allowing complex functionality.

To use, `make`, then `./test`. Option to add a comma-delimited input file in
the style of the included "inputtest1.txt". This can be invoked with "./test
inputfile.txt" or similar. File input parsing is experimental and not
guaranteed to work as intended. For guaranteed results, use the manual prompt
produced by "./test".
